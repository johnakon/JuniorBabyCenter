- Usually, Parents leave home and go for work early in the morning and have babies (young children) to be taken care of. Sometimes a parent may hire a baby sitter or nanny but recently it has been hard to find good baby sitters who can be trusted.  That is where Junior Baby Center comes in - to provide a trust worthy platform from where babby good sitters can be can be contacted to take care of babies or children.

- Also, Junior Bbay Center aims at providing "part-time" baby sitters. Typically parents do not need to hire a full time baby sitter to take care of their children since the parent will still come home after work. Junior Baby Center provides a platform on which a baby sitter can be contacted to take care of the babies (and) or young children just for a few hours when the parents are either away or busy.
